Learning About Jenkins
==================================
What is Jenkins?--> It's CI/CD tool

*Stages Involved in jenkins is 
1.Continuos Download
2.Continuous Build
3.Continuous Deployment
4.Continuous Testing
5.Continuous Delivery

The above four stages are called as Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivey which is called CI/CD

*Here i have performed on aws by taking ubuntu 18.04 instances and naming as dev,qa,prod and slave(for master slave configuration)

*In this I have learned about performing freestyle projects and here we need to install some plugins to work.We need to generate the artifact in dev
and we need to deploy to qa and after qa testing stage should be passed and after that it should be deployable to prod from dev
where application comes in to live.

*I have learned how to create users and manage roles and assign roles to particular job and by default the master is the default node in jenkins
when we want to distrubitve the load we will create master slave configuration, here i have learned how to create another node and how make the jobs
to run on the create node other than master.

*I have learnt how to integrate jenkins with email,so that we will get notification through an email.

*But majorly everything will be build by using piplines jobs, there are two types of jobs 1. Scripted 2. Declarative

*I have build using Scripted pipeline by generating Grovvy scipt, defining the jobs in pipeline tab which we will generate the script from 
Genarate Pipeline script tab

*I have learnt multibranch pipeline by creating multibranch folder and performing actions on github,and created seperate branch and every branch
ha it's own jenkinsfile and job runs on individual job when we push any changes to repoistory
